### what is grpc
- it is a part of the cloud native computing foundation -cncf
- what is `g`? 
  - g stands for different things in each grpc release 
  - rpc means remote procedure calls
  - developers don't have to explicitly coding the details of the network interaction

### how grpc works 
- client has a  generated stub that provides the same methods as the server
- the stub calls grpc framework under the hood to exchange information over network
- client and server use stubs to interact with each other

### how stubs are generated?
- api contracts description
  - the serivces and paylad messages are defined using `protocol buffer`
- server and client stubs are generated by the 
  - protocol buffer compiler
  - grpc plugins of each language 


### why grpc use protocl buffers 
- human readable interface definition language
- binary data representaion
  - smaller size
  - faster to transport
  - more efficient to serialize / deserialize 
- strongly typed contract 
- conventions for api evolution
  - backward forward compatibility


### http2 
- grpc uses http2 as transfer protocol
-  binary framing 
   -  more performant and robust 
   -  lighter to transport, safter to decode 
   -  great combination with protocol buffer
- header compression using hpack 
- multiplexing 
  - send multiple requests and response in parallel
  - over a single tcp connection
  - reduce latency and improve network utilization
- server push 
  - one client request, multiple response 
  
### how http2 works under the hood 
- single tcp connection carries multiple bidirectional streams 
- each stream has a unique id and caries multiple bidirectional messages 

#### what is multiplexing 
- multiplexin이란 단순히 말해서 브라우저가 하나의 컨넥션 상에서 동시에 여러개의 request를 보내는 기술을 의미


### grpc is better than rest?
#### 4 types of grpc 
- unary 
  - one client - one server 
- client streaming 
  -  the client will send a stream of multiple messages and it expects the server to send back only 1 single response
- server streaming 
  - Where the client sends only 1 request message And the server replies with a stream of multiple messages
- bidirectional streaming 
  - most complexing,  arbitray order , it is very flexible and no blocking 
  -  no sides need to wait for the response before sending the next message
  
#### grpc vs rest 
- grpc protobuf strict, requried  built-in  tls/ssl  bidirectional
- rest json loose, optional third-party(swagger) tls/ssl one direction


#### where grpc is well suited to?
- microservice 
  - low latency and high throuhput communication
  - strong api contracy 
- polyglot envrionments
  - code generation out of box for many lanugages
- point-to-point realtime communication
- network cosntrained envrionments
